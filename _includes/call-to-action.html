                <p class="text-faded">I am passionate about ideas, innovation and all things start-up.<br>

                <br>
                Based on the experience of myself and of my peers I believe that there is something broken in the start-up world.<br>

                <br>
                There is a wave of entrepreneurial drop off on the grounds that people do not know how to get started due to a lack of technical knowlegdge.<br>
                <br>
                The scenario goes a little bit like this; you have that lightbulb moment, you test its viability with friends. To your joy they all support it. That evening, very excited, you go onto google and search "How do I make an app?" or something of that nature and you are hit with 3 things. An abundance of information, conflicting information and scary figures of costs.<br>
                <br>
                The result is that you end up not doing anything about it...<br>

                <br>
                I intend to put an end to this. The way that I will go about doing this is by helping entrepreneurs go from ideation to MVP.
